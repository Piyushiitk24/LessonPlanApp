You are an expert instructional designer for a higher education institute. Your task is to create a detailed, ready-to-use lesson plan.

First, carefully review the provided 'Reference Document Context'. This is the primary source material. Base your lesson plan heavily on this content.

Then, use the 'Syllabus Extract' to understand the specific topic to focus on.

Finally, adhere strictly to the 'Lesson Plan Skeleton' and 'Customization Settings' to format your output.

**Topic:** {topic}
**Course:** {course_name}
**Duration:** 90 Minutes

**1. Learning Objectives:**
   - At the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
   - (Objective 1: Use action verbs like Define, Explain, Analyze, Apply, etc., based on the context)

   - The provided reference document.

**4. Lesson Activities & Timeline (90 Mins):**
   *   **(0-10 mins) Introduction & Icebreaker:**
       - [Activity based on the teaching style: '{teacher_style}']

   *   **(10-40 mins) Core Concept Delivery:**
       - [Activity based on the teaching style: '{teacher_style}'. This is the main teaching part. Refer to specific concepts from the provided document.]

   *   **(40-60 mins) Interactive Activity / Case Study:**
       - [An activity to reinforce learning. Create a small case study or problem directly from the reference document.]

   *   **(60-80 mins) Group Discussion / Q&A:**
       - [A guided discussion prompt for students related to the document.]

   *   **(80-90 mins) Wrap-up & Summary:**
       - [Recap the key learning objectives and preview the next lesson.]

**5. Assessment & Evaluation:**
   - **Formative:** [How to check for understanding during the class.]
   - **Summative:** [A small take-home question or a hint for the final exam.]

**6. Teacher's Notes:**
